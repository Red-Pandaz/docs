# Chain operator best practices

The following information has some best practices around running the OP Stack's
off-chain components.

## Correct release versions

Chain and node operators should always run the latest production releases of
the OP Stack's off chain components. Our latest releases, notes, and changelogs
can be found on GitHub. `op-node` releases can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/releases)
and `op-geth` releases can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/releases).

*   Production releases are always tags, versioned as
    `<component-name>/v<semver>`. For example, an `op-node` release might be
    versioned as `op-node/v1.7.5`.
*   Tags of the form `v<semver>`, such as `v1.7.7`, indicate releases of all
    Go code only, and **DO NOT** include smart contracts.
*   In the monorepo, this means these `v<semver>` releases contain all `op-*`
    components, and exclude all `contracts-*` components.
*   `op-geth` embeds upstream geth's version inside its own version as follows:
    `vMAJOR.GETH_MAJOR GETH_MINOR GETH_PATCH.PATCH`. Basically, geth's version is
    our minor version. For example, if geth is at `v1.12.0`, the corresponding
    `op-geth` version would be `v1.101200.0`. Note that we pad out to three
    characters for the geth minor version and two characters for the geth patch
    version. Since we cannot left-pad with zeroes, the geth major version is not
    padded.

## Keep deployment artifacts

After deploying your contracts on Ethereum, you should keep a record of all the
deployment artifacts:

*   Contract release tag and commit hash.
*   Contract deployment configuration file. This is the JSON file you created.
and passed to the deployment script when you deployed the contracts.
*   Contract deployment directory with smart contract artifacts. This is
created in [packages/contracts-bedrock/deployments](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/deployments).
*   The rollup configuration file that you generated after the contract
deployment.
*   The genesis file that you generated after the contract deployment.

## Incremental upgrade rollouts 

When upgrading your nodes, take a staggered approach. This means deploying the
upgrade gradually across your infrastructure and ensuring things work as
expected before making changes to every node.

## Isolate your sequencer 

You can isolate your sequencer node by not connecting it directly to the
internet. Instead, you could handle your ingress traffic behind a proxy. Have 
the proxy forward traffic to replicas and have them gossip the transactions 
internally.

## Improve reliability of peer-to-peer transactions 

These flags can improve the reliability of peer-to-peer transactions from internal replica nodes and the sequencer node.

For sequencer nodes:

```
GETH_TXPOOL_JOURNAL: ""
GETH_TXPOOL_JOURNALREMOTES: "false"
GETH_TXPOOL_NOLOCALS: "true"
```

For replica nodes:

```
GETH_TXPOOL_JOURNALREMOTES: "true"
GETH_TXPOOL_LIFETIME: "1h"
GETH_TXPOOL_NOLOCALS: "true"
```

For additional information about these flags, check out our [Execution Layer Configuration Options](/builders/node-operators/configuration/execution-config) doc.

## Write your own runbooks

Create custom runbooks to prepare for operating an OP Stack chain. For a deeper understanding of daily operations and best practices, explore the public [OP Mainnet Runbooks](https://oplabs.notion.site/OP-Mainnet-Runbooks-120f153ee1628045b230d5cd3df79f63) to see how these practices could be applied to your own chain.

## Assumptions

### op-proposer assumes archive mode 

The `op-proposer` currently assumes that `op-geth` is being run in archive
mode. This will likely be updated in a future network upgrade, but it is 
necessary for L2 withdrawals at the moment.
